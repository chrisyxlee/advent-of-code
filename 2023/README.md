# advent-of-code-2022

These are my solutions (and sometimes wrong answers) to the [2022 Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

My primary objective is to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I've used Go and C++ for work and OCaml back in college. I'm a practical learner, so I'm just trying things out and seeing what sticks.

My secondary objective (after learning the basics of Rust) is to go back and clean up the code with what I've learned.
